Student Nexus is designed to assist students throughout their university journey by providing a centralized platform that simplifies interactions with universities, brokers, and property listings. This platform aims to streamline the experience for students after they have finalized their university and course selection. With a variety of features for managing user profiles, university data, and accommodation options, Student Nexus offers a comprehensive solution tailored to the needs of university students.

The main objective of Student Nexus is to create a user-friendly, all-in-one platform that empowers students with tools to efficiently handle university-related information and easily find suitable housing. This project serves as a robust foundation for a full-featured platform that supports students in managing various aspects of their academic and personal lives.

Key Features
Profile Creation and Management: Students can create and manage their profiles, which include essential information about their university, course, and personal preferences. This allows for a customized experience based on their specific needs and requirements.

University Data Management: The platform includes functionality to manage information related to universities, such as campus details, departments, and student services. This ensures that students have easy access to relevant university information in one place.

Broker and Property Listings: Student Nexus simplifies the housing search by enabling students to explore property listings from trusted brokers. Brokers can list available properties, and students can filter and select accommodations that suit their preferences.

Streamlined Onboarding Process: The platform supports students during their university onboarding by providing all necessary resources and tools to help them settle into university life smoothly.

Housing Search and Customization: Students can search for housing options based on location, rent, type, and other factors, making it easier to find accommodations that fit their criteria. Additionally, they can customize their profile to receive tailored recommendations.

# Tech Stack Used for frontend-
React
TypeScript
CSS
HTML

# Tech Stack Used for backend-
REST API Architecture
Postman
Swagger
ExpressJs
MongoDB


# Steps to run frontend-
`cd app` - Change Directory to app folder
`npm i` - This installs node modules dependencies which are mentioned in package json

# Steps to run backend-
`cd server` - change directory to server
`npm i` - this install node modules required as per package json
`npm start` - to start backend service


# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
